    <p>
        Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome’s science faculty to study as part <br>
        of your <abbr title="Doctor of Pilosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.

    <h3>
        Starting dates
    </h3>
    <p>
        We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you <br>

    <h3>
        Subjects of study
    </h3>
    <p>
        At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall <br>somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just<br> the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br> by are as follows, in order of priority:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Rcsveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplaycrs at tcmpraturcs exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the<br>
            audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> > 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
        <li><u<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>

    So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the<br> research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.

    <h3>
        Exotic dance moves
    </h3>

    <p>
        Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work. I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, <br>
        my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
    </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>
                Polynesian chicken dance
            </dt>
                <br>
            <dd>
                A little known but <em>very</em> influential dance dating back as far as <time>300 <abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>.</time> a whole village would dance around<br> 
                in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".
            </dd>
                <br>
        
            <dt>
                Icelandic brownian shuffle
            </dt>
                <br>
            <dd>
                Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which<br> 
                involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in impcrccptably<br> 
                tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br> 
                modem styles such as Twerking.
            </dd>
                <br>
        
            <dt>
                Arctic robot dance
            </dt>
                <br>
            <dd>
                An interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers in the <time>1960s</time> believed to have<br> discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants<br> of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br> because they were really cold.
